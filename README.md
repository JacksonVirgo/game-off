# Game Off

## Core Mechanic

Card-based game on a large-ish grid of hexagonal double-sided tiles with a tile in the center.

The center tile is the `core`. It emanates a strong energy wave consistently.

Tiles adjacent to the core gets flipped when the wave hits it. Then the wave propogates outwards away from the core.

The wave propogates by one each turn. Every turn the player may place down X tiles onto any empty face-up space.

Each tile does Y thing on a condition.

Resource management? Base creation? We'll figure that out later
